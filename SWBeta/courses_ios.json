In the second round the 4th finger can be introduced if it is not too much of a muscle effort at this point. Pressing the pinky with a round manner is not the priority. Fingers can be put on the fingerboard rather flatly to not over work the muscles. A firm press on the pinky does not require too much pressure so keep in mind the trick of \"touching the string to the wood\" instead of \"pressing down deeply\".</p>\n \n<p>\n \n\n<p></p>",

A good way to introduce the learner to the basic vocabulary of classical music.

This can interrupt the flow your your scale, leading you to not play legato, or press notes wrongly, resulting in a noise. The best way to make position changes during scales is to use the moment you reach to an open string note. Since you're not pressing any note at that moment, your hand is free to move to the next position, without interrupting the sound. Thus, when you reach to the open E on the first string, you'll\u00a0 use that moment to drag your 3rd finger from D to F# on the second string. That way you successfully transfer your hand from the 1st to the 5th position.</p>\n \n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>",

Via various exercises you will explore the freedom of movement of your finger in order to raise muscle awareness. Keep in mind to always rest the attacks of your thumb on the side of your right index finger. Do not let the thumb go behind your fingers nor too forward away from your hand, as this will alter the correct placement of your fingers.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>",

Not only will you be working on what you do with your left hand fingers (a.k.a. 1, 2, 3,4), but also about your palm, wrist, elbow, shoulder, up to your collarbone. Another aspect you will focus on is the thumb of your left hand, the backbone of every note you will ever press with your left hand\u2019s fingers.

We wouldn\u2019t say \u201cPlay the C after the 4th string louder\u201d, but we would say \u201cPlay the C after the D louder\u201d.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then again, guitar having many strings, plenty of notes to cover, and many notes that can be played on various strings, at times we approach certain hand positions by shape and number coordination rather than note names, such as \u201cplace your 2nd finger on the 3rd fret of the 4th string\u201d instead of \u201cplay the F that is the second octave of the instrument on the lowest possible string\u201d.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in short, we will start our journey by learning the names and numbers of the strings for future convenience!</span></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>",

It is exactly the point of this scale to start from the lowest possible note you can get on the violin that belongs to the scale of D major. This means that our first note will be the low G. This \u201ctaking you out of the traditional perception of tonality\u201d helps you to learn what each pitch really sounds like. On a more technical end, make sure your elbows follow each other parallelly as you go up and down the scale.</p>",

With each one of these five etudes you will be introduced to the common arpeggio practice and how the composers applied it in their compositions. Stylistically and technically speaking, the guitar arpeggios of this era are characterised by combinations of the right hand finger that create complex textures out of a series of chord progressions. This means that throughout this method you will not be practicing horizontal arpeggios produced by the left hand, but the vertical textures offered by the right hand.\n\nThe method consists of a selection of etudes from&nbsp;<strong>Theme varies et 12 Minuets, Op. 11</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>24 Progressive Lessons Op. 31</strong>&nbsp;by Fernando Sor, and <strong>25 Etudes Melodiques, Op. 60</strong> by Mateo Carcassi.\n\nThere is a continuous rise in the difficulty level throughout the method, so it is recommended that you feel comfortable playing the etudes from the first steps before engaging on a harder piece of a later step. You can listen to the whole set of pieces and understand that they do share similar classical vocabulary, therefore knowing one piece WILL make it easier to learn the next one.&nbsp;\n\nIf you wish to further explore the classical arpeggio technique, check out our \u201cMaster the Classical Guitar Arpeggios \u2013 Part 6\u201d available on Scorewind\u2019s methods page.\n<h4>Requirement</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\nAdvanced level of score reading ability.</li>\n <li>\nAdvanced level in melody playing in various position.</li>\n <li>\nProficiency in right hand arpeggio techniques.</li>\n <li>\nProficiency in position changing.</li>\n <li>\nProficiency in barr\u00e9 technique.</li>\n <li>\nAdvanced level in playing chords.</li>\n <li>\nAbility to play pieces in C, G, D, A and E Major.</li>\n <li>\nFluency in performing parallel voicings (up to 4 voices).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What's next</h4>\nNext course: <a href=\"https://scorewind.com/courses/master-the-classical-guitar-arpeggios-part-6/\">Master the Classical Guitar Arpeggios - Part 6</a>",

Having said this, we are not talking about doing an accent on the first beat, it's rather a light fall or placing some weight on it. Following the ternary bar with the movement of your body can help you feel better this waltz-like sensation. More on the technical end, pay attention to playing the midnotes by the\u00a03rd beat exactly at the same time,\u00a0since there usually is a tendency to do the\u00a0opposite.

								"lesson_content": "<p>This course (part 2) is for players to challenge themselves to a long lasting piece; a movement from a concerto by Frederich Seitz! Playing a concerto doesn\u2019t mean playing something that is harder than before, but it needs a longer lasting concentration since the piece itself is longer. The steps on the way are selected to keep the musical ideas running, most of them are very melodic pieces and some are etudes that prepare the player to the challenges that lie ahead. Phrase lengths are rather longer towards the end, also to prepare the player to the pace of a concerto where musical phrases tend to last longer than in shorter pieces.</p>\n<p>Although technical difficulties of each piece is rather similar within this collected group of pieces, they are not meant to be played precisely with the given order. Yet they can help each other out; since learning classical vocabulary is like learning a new language; knowing one piece WILL make it easier to learn the next one. There is a difficulty level rise to some extend towards the last pieces. You can listen to the whole set of pieces and start from whichever piece you feel the interest for.&nbsp;</p>",

Focus on having a good horizontal alignement between the 1st and 4th finger, and that there is always a fair amount of space between your fingers (this will help you a lot, not only in this case, but for your whole left hand positioning foundation).

The biggest challenge you will encounter in this scale is the incredible extension in the first string between the notes e, f, g, a; an up to the fifth fret stretch. The key here is to open up your left hand knuckles as you reach to the f, in order to be prepared to play the g and the a, and later be ready to descend on the scale. With this type of preparation you will be saving time and effort.

It is always that one value (a half, quarter, eight, sixteenth note) plus its half; so, one and a half value every time. In this case our dotted rhythm will be done with 8th and 16th notes. First you will only play a base of 8th notes, then you\u2019ll subdivide every second 8th note into two 16th notes, and finally you will omit the first 16th note and add the value of that note to the 8th note that you just played.

								"lesson_content": "<p>Parallel Thirds E Minor in Closed Position</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>We recommend you to keep your fingers prepared at all times when playing parallel thirds. Making sure that your knuckles are open wide and that the fingertips are just ready to drop on the strings, will help you successfully play parallel thirds. This will avoid lack of legato and eliminate the chance of producing noisy notes. When you have position changes, keep in mind to make the shifts quickly, otherwise you lose legato or it will sound to glissando technique. Remember that making quick shifts doesn\u2019t mean the same as playing fast through the exercise. The beat and the duration of the notes should stay stable.</p>",

This is a common tool used to increase the comfort levels at the time of playing any passage with their original rhythm. In this case, we add dotted rhythm to a passage that would otherwise be written in 8th notes. With the new rhythm, you get less time to change between notes, and therefore you need to be extra careful with things such as finger preparation and fast position changes.</p>",

The secret is to keep your fingers prepared at all times. Those knuckles cannot stay cramped together, but open wide and rounded. Keep an eye for the position change when you reach the first string. In order to keep the legato running, the position shifts must be done quickly, lightly ,and cleanly. The mental equation to help you with the various stages is: \u201c\u2026play - wait - change and play - wait\u201d. This must happen within the correct rhythm and pulse.</p>",

But in order to keep our wrists smooth and steady, we need to angle our elbows in a suitable position with our hands\u2019 angle based on which string our fingers are going to land on. This video includes a very calming exercise for this awareness to develop without thinking much technical about it; simply imaging a cute and sleepy creature curling up on the inside of our elbows will help us swing our elbows gently, like a pendulum under control of the gravity, and relax our left wrist to its optimum while technically scanning through the range of all strings we have at hand.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>",

Moving only our fingers and a little bit of our palm, we can change the bow angle in so many ways. Knowing this will help you gain the required elasticity while playing the violin with the bow, since all these angle changes will be executed on one single bowing.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>",
